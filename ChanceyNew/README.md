# DiagrammingTool

Chancey works as an assistive tech educator at the New York Public Library. As a tech savvy woman who is visually impaired, she uses a screen reader and does a lot of planning and diagramming using a tactile diagramming tablet. Last year, she had to organize the seating arrangement for a banquet and found it difficult.



Together we are working on an online diagr
amming tool for touch screen devices, that is compatible with her screen reader.
